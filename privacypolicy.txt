This Privacy Policy explains how Sight (the “Bot”) collects, uses, and stores data. Sight is created and operated by lOLORANGElol (Discord User ID: 1420537388698046614) (“Developer”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”).
By using Sight, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

Because the Developer is based in Germany, all data handling is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable German privacy laws.

Depending on your server configuration and the commands/features you use, the Bot may collect or process:

1.1 Message Data

Edited/deleted message logs (if enabled by the server)

1.2 Server Membership Data

List of users in the server

Why:
For role-based commands, permissions, moderation features, statistics, and server management tools.

1.3 Presence & Activity Data

Online/offline/idle/do-not-disturb status

1.4 Server Configuration & Permission Data

Changes to role permissions

Server configuration settings specific to Sight

2. How We Use the Data

Sight uses collected data to:

Provide bot features such as moderation, logging, automation, or analytics

Improve stability and performance

Maintain server-specific configurations

Ensure correct access control and permissions

Prevent abuse and detect debugging issues

Data is not used for:

Selling to third parties

Advertising

Profiling outside the bot’s functional scope

3. How Long We Keep Data

Data may be stored only as long as required for functionality.

Typical retention rules:

Message logs: Stored only if the server enables logging; duration depends on server settings.

Configuration data: Kept until the server removes the bot.

Debug logs: Short-term storage only for error diagnosis.

If the bot is removed from your server, associated configuration data may be deleted automatically.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or disclose your data to any third-party organizations.

Data may be shared only in these rare cases:

Legal requirement (court order or lawful authority request in Germany/EU)

Security situations (attacks, abuse reports, or data integrity incidents)

Sight does not transfer data outside the EU unless required by Discord’s own infrastructure.

5. Your Rights (GDPR)

Because the Bot is operated under German and EU law, you have the following rights:

Right to Access – Ask what data is stored or processed

Right to Correction – Request correction of inaccurate data

Right to Deletion – Request deletion of stored data where applicable

Right to Limit Processing

Right to Object

Right to Data Portability

To submit a request, contact the Developer via Discord.

6. Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect stored data, including:

Restricted access

Limited retention

No unnecessary data storage

Secure hosting environments (where applicable)

However, no system is perfectly secure. You use the Bot at your own risk.

7. Children’s Privacy

The Bot is intended for Discord users who meet Discord’s minimum age requirements (typically 13+).
We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.

8. Third-Party Services

Sight interacts with the Discord API, which is governed by:

Discord’s Privacy Policy

Discord’s Terms of Service

Discord may independently collect or process your data.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time.
Continued use of Sight after updates means you accept the new policy.
